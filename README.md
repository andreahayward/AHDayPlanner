# AHDayPlanner
For this homework assignment, I updated the HTML, JS, and CSS files to format the day planner. On the HTML file I created containers for each of the time slots (9:00am - 7:00pm). On the CSS file, I changed some of the fonts and colors. On the JS, I added code to save the users input to local storage so that it remained when the page refreshed. I used moment to add the current time to the top and also to track what time it was in the day in relation to the hours on the day planner.
