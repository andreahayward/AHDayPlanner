# AHDayPlanner
For this homework assignment, I updated the HTML, JS, and CSS files to format the day planner. On the HTML file I created containers for each of the time slots (8:00am - 7:00pm). On the CSS file, I changed some of the fonts and colors. On the JS, I added code to save the users input to local storage so that it remained when the page refreshed.
